## Overview
This is my recreation of the blog preview designed by frontend mentor. My second creation comes with a tiny amount more experience and an even tinier amount less frustration.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
I started by finishing the html that was prewritten and moving towards what I knew in css. After completing what I knew I started using refrences from my last project and locating youtube videos to help me understand what I was doing right, but more importantly, what I was doing wrong.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I am by far most proud of the use of min-height and max-width to make my webpage more responsive. Discovering how to properly use that made coding so much easier for me


```css
.container {
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    max-width: 384px;
    min-height: 522px;
    padding: 24px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    border: .75px solid;
    box-shadow: 8px 8px 0px black;
}
```

### Continued development

Everything in general needs improvement, but thats what im here for.
